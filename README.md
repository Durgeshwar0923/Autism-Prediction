This project focuses on autism spectrum disorder (ASD) prediction using multiple machine learning algorithms to ensure a comprehensive evaluation of predictive performance. The following models are utilized:

Support Vector Classifier (SVC) – Effective for high-dimensional data and margin-based classification.
Logistic Regression – A simple yet powerful statistical model for binary classification.
XGBoost – A gradient boosting algorithm known for its efficiency and accuracy.
Random Forest – An ensemble learning method that improves prediction stability and reduces overfitting.
By implementing multiple algorithms, the project compares their performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, ensuring a robust and reliable approach to ASD detection.
